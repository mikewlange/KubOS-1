KubOS-2016.01 - Release Notes
============================

KubOS-2016.01 IS NOT FUNCTIONAL - It will build clean, but IT WILL NOT RUN

KubOS is a real-time multi-threading operating system that supports a range of
devices that are typically found in micro and nano satellites: devices based on
8-bit microcontrollers, 16-bit microcontrollers and 32-bit
microcontrollers.

KubOS is based on the following design principles: energy-efficiency, real-time
capabilities, small memory footprint, reliability, modularity, and uniform API access
independent of the underlying hardware.

KubOS is developed by an international open source community which is
independent of specific vendors (e.g. similarly to the Linux community).
